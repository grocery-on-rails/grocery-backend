// NOTE: we agreed to use snake case :p


// ** categories vs subcategories issue **
// let's deal with "category" as an abstract concept
// a category is a collection of subcategories
// every product should have a property subcategory: List<subcategory>
//               but not a category property
// clicking on subcategory => redirects you to searching with no restriction filtered with the subcategory
// the only place where we would need category:
//      category page to display the subcategories
